The Study Helper API is the server-side component of our study management application. It is built using Ruby on Rails, a popular web application framework. This README file provides an overview of the backend application, installation instructions, and usage guide.

Features
1. Activity Management
Create: Students can add new activities to their study plan by providing details such as the activity name, description, due date, and type (Codility challenge, lab, or content work).

Read: Users can view a list of all their activities, sorted by due date or type, allowing them to quickly check their study schedule.

Update: Modify existing activities by editing their details, such as changing the due date or description.

Delete: Remove activities that are no longer relevant or have been completed.

2. Progress Tracking
The app provides a visual representation of the student's study progress through charts and statistics, helping them understand their strengths and weaknesses.

Users can filter activities by type or date range to focus on specific areas of their study plan.

Endpoint: POST /login
Description: Authenticate a user and generate a session.
Usage: Allows users to log in by providing their email and password. If the provided credentials are valid, the user is logged in, and a session is created.

Authentication 
The Study Helper App includes an authentication mechanism to ensure that only authorized users can access certain parts of the application. The authentication logic is implemented in the ApplicationController:

Authorization Check: Before allowing access to certain actions, the before_action :authorized filter is applied. This filter checks for the presence of a :user_id in the session, which indicates that a user is authenticated and logged in.

Excluded Actions: Some actions, such as login, show, index, and create, are exempt from the authorization check using except: [:login, :show, :index, :create]. This means that these actions can be accessed without requiring authentication.

Unauthorized Access Handling: If a user is not authorized (i.e., session[:user_id] is not present), the API will return a JSON response with an "Unauthorized" error message and a status code of 401 (HTTP status code for unauthorized access).
